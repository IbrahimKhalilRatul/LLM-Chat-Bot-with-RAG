# LLM-Chat-Bot-with-RAG and Deepseek R1

This project is an LLM-powered chatbot that provides personalized, context-aware advice for healthcare, career, education, and more. Built with DeepSeek R1 (via Ollama) and Groq, it uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate, up-to-date responses.
Right now it can predict and analyze the drug information and drug interaction as well as suggestions.
